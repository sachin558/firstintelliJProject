//Q1) Write a program to create a class named shape. It should contain 2 methods,
// draw() and erase() that prints “Drawing Shape” and “Erasing Shape” respectively.
//Q2) Design a class that can be used by a health care professional to keep track of a patient’s vital statistics. The following are the details.
//   Name of the class - Patient
// Member Variables - patientName(String),height(double),width(double)
// Member Function - double computeBMI()
//  The above method should compute the BMI and return the result. The formula for computation of BMI  is weight (in kg) ÷ height*height(in metres).
//  Create an object of the Patient class and check the results.

    String a ;
